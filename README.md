# Dashboard

## What is this and who am I?

In short: this is a dashboard where students and teachers can keep track of grades and progress for multiple subjects/students. For the details on the functionality see the [user stories](#userStories).

A live version of the dashboard with dummy data can be found [here](https://compassionate-raman-97ce78.netlify.app/).

## Who am I?

I am part of class #40, attending an 11 week JavaScript bootcamp at [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/).

For seven weeks the teachers at Codaisseur have been teaching us a variety of [skills](https://willemverbuyst.github.io/threeJS-react-list/) to prepare us for a career in full-stack web-development. This project is the fruit of this. We got two weeks to build a project from scratch showcasing the techniques we have learned and explore some _terra icognita_.
